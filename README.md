# Horiseon-Refactor

## Description

I had starter code that needed to be refactored for accessiblity issues. I made changes to both the style.css file as well as the index.html file to clean up the code and add semantic elements.


## Installation
No installation required. Please view the webpage that is live using github pages at the following link: https://kkittrell.github.io/Horiseon-refactor/


## Usage

This can be used to see how making accessibility changes can be made to make an existing website more accessible.
